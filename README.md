## Password Requirements

The password input requires the following:
- Minimum of **8 characters**
- At least **1 uppercase letter**
- At least **1 lowercase letter**
- At least **1 number**
This is enforced using the following regex pattern:

```regex
^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-zA-Z]).{8,}$
```

If the **Confirm Password** field doesnâ€™t match, the user is notified immediately.
